AnyEvent::Beanstalk - Async client to talk to beanstalkd server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     server => "localhost",
  );

  # Send a job with explicit data
  my $job = $client->put(

      ttr      => 120,

  # Send job, data created by encoding @args. By default with YAML
  my $job2 = $client->put(

      ttr      => 120,
      delay    => 5,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<AnyEvent::Beanstalk> provides a Perl API of protocol version 1.3 to the beanstalkd server,
a fast, general-purpose, in-memory workqueue service by Keith Rarick.

See the L<beanstalkd 1.3 protocol spec|http://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/blob/v1.3/doc/protocol.txt?raw=true>
for greater detail

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructor

=over

=item B<new (%options)>

Any of the attributes with accessor methods described below may be passed to the constructor as key-value pairs

=back

=head2 Attribute Accessor Methods

=over

=item B<server ([$hostname])>

Get/set the hostname, and port, to connect to. The port, which defaults to 11300, can be
specified by appending it to the hostname with a C<:> (eg C<"localhost:1234">).
(Default: C<localhost:11300>)

=item B<delay ([$delay])>

Set/get a default value, in seconds, for job delay. A job with a delay will be
placed into a delayed state and will not be placed into the ready queue until
the time period has passed.  This value will be used by C<put> and C<release> as
a default. (Default: 0)

=item B<ttr ([$ttr])>

Set/get a default value, in seconds, for job ttr (time to run). This value will
be used by C<put> as a default. (Default: 120)

=item B<priority ([$priority])>

Set/get a default value for job priority. The highest priority job is the job
where the priority value is the lowest (ie jobs with a lower priority value are
run first). This value will be used by C<put>, C<release> and C<bury> as a
default. (Default: 10000)

=item B<encoder ([$encoder])>

Set/get serialization encoder. C<$encoder> is a reference to a subroutine
that will be called when arguments to C<put> need to be encoded to send
to the beanstalkd server. The subroutine should accept a single argument and
return a string representation to pass to the server. The default is to encode
the argument using YAML

=item B<decoder ([$decoder])>

Set/get the serialization decoder. C<$decoder> is a reference to a

to decode using YAML.

an enexpected EOF. A description will be passed as an argument. The default is to call
die

A code reference to call when the TCP connection has been established with the server

=back

=head2 Communication Methods

All methods that communicate with the server take an optional code reference as the last
argument and return a L<condition variable|AnyEvent/"CONDITION_VARIABLES">.

The condition variable C<recv> method will return 2 values. The first is specific to
the command that is being performed and is referred to below as the response value.
The second value returned by C<recv> is the first line of the protocol response.

If there is a protocol error the response value will be C<undef>.

If a callback is specified then the callback will be called with the same arguments
that the C<recv> method would return.

Calling C<recv> in a scalar context will only return the first of the two values.

If there is a communication error, then all condition variables will be triggered
with no values.

=head2 Producer Methods

These methods are used by clients that are placing work into the queue

=over

=item B<put ($options, [$callback])>

Insert job into the currently used tube.

The response value for a C<put> is a L<AnyEvent::Beanstalk::Job> object.

Options may be

=over

=item priority

priority to use to queue the job.
Jobs with smaller priority values will be
scheduled before jobs with larger priorities. The most urgent priority is 0

Defaults to the current value of the L<priority|/priority> attribute

=item delay

An integer number of seconds to wait before putting the job in
the ready queue. The job will be in the "delayed" state during this time

Defaults to the current value of the L<delay|/delay> attribute

=item ttr

"time to run" - An integer number of seconds to allow a worker
to run this job. This time is counted from the moment a worker reserves
this job. If the worker does not delete, release, or bury the job within
C<ttr> seconds, the job will time out and the server will release the job.
The minimum ttr is 1. If the client sends 0, the server will silently
increase the ttr to 1.

Defaults to the current value of the L<ttr|/ttr> attribute

=item data

The job body. If not specified, the value of the C<encode> option is used

=item encode

Value to encode and pass as job body, if C<data> option is not passed.

Defaults to the empty string.

FIFO linked list and will not be touched by the server again until a client
kicks them with the "kick" command.

The response value for C<bury> is a L<AnyEvent::Beanstalk::Job> object.

Valid options are

=over

Specifies a tube to add to the watch
list. If the tube doesn't exist, it will be created
